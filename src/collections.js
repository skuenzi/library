          "'Beautiful, big-hearted and so original -- I fell in love with this book.' - Amie Kaufman, NYT bestselling author of The World Between Blinks CALLERS CAN CONJURE ANYTHING OUT OF THIN AIR. BUT WHAT IF THE THINGS DON'T COME FROM NOTHING? WHAT IF THEY'RE TAKEN FROM . . . SOMEONE ELSE? In the world of Elipsom, the ability to Call, or summon objects, is a coveted skill. And yet despite being born into a family of Callers, Quin doesn't have the gift. But everything changes when instead of summoning an object, Quin makes something disappear. He quickly discovers that the objects Callers bring into their world aren't conjured at all, but are taken from another land, and another people who have had their lives slowly stolen from them. Now Quin must team up with Allie, a girl who's determined to stop this unjust practice, and decide whether he should remain loyal to his family, or betray them-and save the world. From dazzling newcomer Kiah Thomas comes an arresting, fast-paced and thought-provoking adventure about the consequences of wanting more than we need. PRAISE FOR THE CALLERS 'Lush and dazzling, this enchanting fantasy whisks you away to an inventive world, full of intrigue and adventure. The Callers is captivating to the very end.' - Rhiannon Williams, Ampersand Prize-winning author of the Narroway Trilogy 'Don't we all want to believe we are forces for good and we carry within us some unknown magic power? Beautifully told and engaging and just thrilling. What a great story.' - Printz Honor-winning author Garret Weyr",
