## Personal Library application 

Started as the final project for Promineo Tech Front End Bootcamp, but I've continued to improve it since!

### Stack: Typescripe, React, Semantic-UI, react-router, Google Books API, soon zustand

### Premise

Avid readers often get their material in multiple ways: e-books, audiobooks, or plain old paper. It can be hard to keep track of what they've read, recommendations, new genres, even DNFs (did not finish). This app is a personal library - the user creates unique collections to organize their titles. They can also search for new books (currently only by genre), list their current read, and see some of the top selling books on Google. 


#### Current features: 
- Landing page with recommended titles
  - Search bar (subject/genre only)
- Collections page shows current collections
  - Form to add new collections
  - List of recommended books to add
- Currently reading page
  - Title and summary of current read
 
#### In Progress:
- Search by other keywords
- Implement zustand to save and modify collections and currently reading
- Fix function of 'Add to collection' button
